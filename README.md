# Hotel-Revenue-Analysis
Build a visual data story (Dashboard) to present hotel revenue analysis to the clients

<b> Answering the questions would help us gain some insights such as:</b> </br>
“Is the hotel revenue growing by revenue ?” : We have 2 hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type </br>
“Should we increase our parking lot size ?” : We want to understand if there is a trend in guests with personal cars</br>
“What trends can we see in the data ?” : Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality </br>


<b>The data analysis project pipeline is the following:</b> </br>
1 -  Build a Database : Using SQL Server </br>
2- Develop the SQL Query : running some exploratory Data Analysis</br>
3- Connect Power BI to the Database</br>
4- Visualize</br>
5- Summarize</br>
